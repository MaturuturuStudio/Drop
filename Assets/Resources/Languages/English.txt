And all drops have one destiny. The sea.\n\nGo to the sea, little drop, go to the sea and find your beloved people. Use all your abilities to pass all the obstacles and difficulties of the journey. Jump in the walls, join other drops, split yourself and fit small sites, shoot yourself at high, irrigate plants...\n\nBe smart, be water my friend.
