And all drops have one destiny. The sea.\n\nGo to the sea, little drop, go to the sea and find your beloved friends. Use all of your abilities to pass the obstacles and difficulties of the journey. Jump in the walls, join other drops, split yourself and fit small sites, shoot yourself at high, irrigate plants...\n\nBe smart, be water my friend.
